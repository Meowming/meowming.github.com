    "## Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week we have something special for a quiz. You will create your own reddit bot (or bots) and then fill in the quiz in canvas. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reddit is considered DarkWeb. That being said, naviagte at your own risk, there are really dark sections of redit but as long as you stay withint the popular subreddits you should be fine\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Never post anything that may idenitfy you, where you live, or where you study. That includes your username.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I recommend you save your secret text and your password in a file and load it from there. Regardless, when you upload your script be sure it doesn't contain that information\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Really try to do it. This is more challenging than other quiz assignments but it will help you with your project and learning more about expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a bot, you can follow the instructions at the websites I gave you. I recommend you create a new user in reddit to do so but if you want to use your personal user that's on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You are going to create a python script that listens the subreddit /r/popular for comments and submissions. That means you need to run two bots, if you can't do it in parallel do it one after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Choose a word (e.g. python, irvine, peter), make sure you can search for any version of that word by using a regular expression (uppercase, lowercase, plurals). You are going to listen for comments and posts that contain that word for 1 hour (so choose a popular word).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Compile all the posts and comments you gather into a text file, format it so you are able to differentiate one comment from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Using your text file of comments, you are going to create a dictionary of the frequency of words (non-stop) that appear with your words, for example:\n",
    "        The comment: \"Python is a good programming language and I love programming\n",
    "        Returns: {python:1, good:1, programming:2, language:1, love:1}\n",
    "Note: we removed stopwords, use the stopwords.txt from your project 1 to do this. \n",
    "6) With another bot, you will post (new submission, not comment) in 'Peterbot' your word and the 5 top words related to it with their frequency, for example:\n",
    "    Title: My word is 'python'\n",
    "    Content: The top 5 words are programming:500, code:100, love:99, compre"
