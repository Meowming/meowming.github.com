    "At a post office you are given a list of objects to ship together on vehicles. Each list's objects' masses are given in pounds, convert each the provided list from pounds to kilograms (1 lb = 0.453592 kg). Then, calculate the aggregate mass of all the objects in each list for a shipment. Finally, any shipment with a combined mass over 200 kg must be filtered out. Create a function that takes in each list separately, performs the conversion and summation, and appends the aggregate mass to the list g. Run it on the given lists, then filter the list g and print the resulting list of items remaining.\n",
