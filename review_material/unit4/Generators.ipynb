    "# Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created with information from http://www.bogotobogo.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you should know what iterators are.Generators behave like them but are actually functions and exprssions. The advantage of using a generator is memory efficiency, since instead of loading a whole array into memory it only yields the next value (whenever next() is called)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- As functions: Using yield forces the function to generate one value at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "2- As expressions: Similar to comprehensions but instead of populating a list it only returns the results on deman in the form of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Both use the iteration protocol (which is why we are learning about them in the iterator unit and not in functional programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yield vs return\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are declared just as you would a function, however they have two main differences (or one difference and a complement). Generators do not return a value/object (well that's not entirely true, they might return a StopIteration exception that means that you can't iterate through the generator anymore because it has arrived to the end of it. Whew that's a big parentheses). Instead they __yield__ a new value whenever they are called. For this they heavily rely on the iterator protocol and the \\__next__() operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the very first thing you should learn about generators is how to use the yield statement. Is a special return exclusive to generators (and  merging lanes on a freeway) that tells the Python machine to compute the value on demand. Let's see an example:"

    "1- We don't need to specify that create_counter is a generator, the presence of yield gives it away. Calling upon it returns a generator that can be used to generate succesive values after n. Note that the first time we call it it yields the original number, that is because we are yielding n before incrementing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Notice that even though we call creat_counter as a function, it doesn't do anything until we call next() on it. Hence the reason that printing it before calling next just tells us that it is a generator function.\n",
