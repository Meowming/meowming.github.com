    "# Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a paradigm just like object oriented programming. In this case, instead of using classes and objects, we model every solution as a set of functions. Therefore, we don't manipulat data directly but instead creat a copy of the data, manipulate it in our function and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been using functional programming already, but this will be a more formal presentation of the topic including the rules of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects. It doesn’t rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn’t change data that exists outside the current function. Every other “functional” thing can be derived from this property. Use it as a guide rope as you learn.\n",
